# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared "supervision missing" predicate.
# Usage: . bin/fm-supervision-lib.sh
#
# Reports whether a firstmate home needs supervision (fm_supervision_status
# below is the single owner of that condition set), and whether its watcher has
# a fresh liveness beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat, touched every poll cycle,
# within the grace window).
# bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh uses the PID-strict fm_watcher_healthy from
# bin/fm-wake-lib.sh for its block decision. bin/fm-guard.sh uses the model-aware
# fm_watcher_supervision_verdict (also in bin/fm-wake-lib.sh), which owns what a
# live watcher process means per supervision model. The status fields here retain
# the beacon-age details used in their messages.

# Portable mtime; Linux stat lacks -f, macOS stat lacks -c.

# fm_supervision_status <state-dir> [grace-seconds]
# Populates, for the state dir at $1:
#   FM_SUP_IN_FLIGHT      count of state/*.meta (in-flight tasks)
#   FM_SUP_SOURCES        count of registered process-to-event sources
#   FM_SUP_CHECKS         count of registered custom checks: a state/<id>.check.sh
#                         with the state/<id>.check-trust binding that
#                         bin/fm-check-register.sh writes. Task PR polls carry no
#                         such binding and are torn down with their task, and the
#                         relay shim keeps its own trust path, so neither counts
#                         here. Presence of the binding is the whole test: whether
#                         those bytes are still the registered ones is the check
#                         sweep's call at execution time, and a home whose check
#                         no longer validates needs the watcher precisely so the
#                         sweep can report the rejection instead of going quiet.
#   FM_SUP_NEEDED         true/false - in-flight work, an X-mode relay poll, a
#                         registered event source (a source is a wait on an
#                         external process, not a task, so it has no metadata),
#                         or a registered custom check
#   FM_SUP_WATCHER_FRESH  true/false - a watcher beacon within the grace window
#   FM_SUP_BEACON_DESC    human-readable beacon age, for banners ("never" if absent)
#   FM_SUP_QUEUE_PENDING  true/false - state/.wake-queue has unread records
# grace-seconds defaults to $FM_GUARD_GRACE, then 300, matching fm-guard.sh.
# Always returns 0; callers read the vars, or use fm_supervision_unhealthy below.
