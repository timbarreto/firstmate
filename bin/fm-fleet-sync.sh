# Refresh project clones: fast-forward the checked-out local default branch to
# origin/<default> when safe, and prune fully merged local branches whose
# upstream tracking branch is gone and that no worktree still needs.
# Self-heals the one unambiguously safe drift: a clean, detached HEAD that holds
# no unique commits (it is an ancestor of origin/<default>) and whose <default>
# branch is free to check out is re-attached and then fast-forwarded ("recovered:").
# Every other off-default state - a non-default named branch, a detached HEAD with
# unique commits, a dirty tree, or a diverged default - may hold real work, so it
# is left untouched and reported as a quantified, loud "STUCK: ... N commits behind
# ... - needs attention" warning rather than a quiet drift. Nothing is ever forced,
# stashed, or discarded.
# Still skips (benignly) local-only/no-origin projects, missing remotes/branches,
# and fetch failures. A project whose registry entry bin/fm-project-mode.sh
# refuses is skipped too, naming that command so its refusal is readable, rather
# than synced under a guessed posture.
# A candidate under projects/ must be the root of its own work tree: git discovery
# walks up, so a plain nested directory would otherwise resolve to the enclosing
# repository (the firstmate checkout) and be synced under that directory's label.
# Anything else is reported as "skipped: not a clone root" naming the repository
# that would have been touched.
# Pruning uses Git's merged-branch guard and never deletes the checked-out branch
# or a branch that still has a worktree; set FM_FLEET_PRUNE=0 to disable it.
# It runs before fast-forwarding, so a branch merged by this refresh may remain
# until the next pass can prove it merged.
# When the fetch fails on an orphaned .git/packed-refs.lock (left by a ref rewrite
# killed mid-write - e.g. a timed-out bootstrap sync or a teardown process kill),
# it is retried with a bounded wait and removed only when provably stale; see
# fetch_with_packed_refs_lock_guard and the FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_* knobs.
# Usage: fm-fleet-sync.sh [<project-dir-or-name>]
# The single-project form accepts either a path (absolute, or relative to the
# caller's cwd) or a bare "<name>"/"projects/<name>" form, resolved against
# this home's projects dir ($FM_HOME/projects, or $FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE).
# Bare names and "projects/<name>" forms prefer this home's projects dir before
# falling back to an explicit path. Example: from anywhere,
# `fm-fleet-sync.sh dotfiles-private` syncs just that one clone, same as
# passing its full projects/dotfiles-private path.
#
# Usage: fm-fleet-sync.sh --request <project-dir-or-name>
# Task cleanup uses this form so it never waits for a clone refresh after its
# worker is already gone. It records one request file under
# state/.fleet-sync-requests/, starts one detached background server, and
# returns at once with a single line naming the request; it never runs the guard,
# which the cleanup already ran. The server serializes on
# state/.fleet-sync-service.lock: a server that finds the lock held waits only
# while requests are pending, and a third server exits at once when one is
# already waiting, because the waiter serves every request filed before it gets
# the lock. Each pass takes a snapshot of the request files, syncs every distinct
# project in it once, and removes exactly those files, so a request filed
# mid-pass is served by the next pass and requests for one project that
# arrive together cost one sync. A server killed mid-pass leaves its requests for the
# next one. Each project sync is bounded by FM_FLEET_SYNC_SERVICE_TIMEOUT
# seconds (default 300). The server never recreates a missing state directory,
# so a retired home stays retired. Its stdout and stderr are appended to the
# bounded state/.fleet-sync.log, and any skipped:, STUCK:, or recovered: line
# that session start would relay as FLEET_SYNC raises one check wake per pass
# naming that log, so diagnostics a synchronous call printed still reach
# firstmate. When the project path is not a directory, the state directory is
# missing, or the request cannot be recorded, the clone is synced in the
# foreground exactly like the single-project form, so clone freshness never
# depends on the background server.
